# SADA
SADA: Sound Audibility Determination Application
SADA is an open-source desktop application designed to simplify the calculation of sound levels in residential and commercial buildings. It leverages established acoustic calculation methods and integrates a user-friendly interface for researchers, engineers, and safety professionals.

# The application supports:

Butler, Bowyer, and Kew Method: Calculates sound levels based on straightforward acoustic principles.
Halliwell and Sultan Method: Incorporates additional parameters for more detailed sound level estimations.
SADA was developed as part of an academic study focused on optimizing fire alarm placement to enhance audibility in residential units.

# Key Features
User-friendly interface for inputting building parameters and calculating sound levels.
Comparison of different calculation methods to understand variability in sound predictions.
Developed with Python's Tkinter library, ensuring simplicity and extensibility.
Open-source platform allowing integration of new calculation methods or updates.
Purpose

# The primary goal of SADA is to facilitate:

SADA simplifies the calculation of Sound Pressure Levels (SPL) using established methods for sound propagation analysis. It is designed to assist with:
SPL Calculations: Automatically compute sound levels using the Butler, Bowyer, and Kew Method and the Halliwell and Sultan Method, ensuring accurate and efficient results.
Configuration Comparisons: Evaluate sound levels across different room and door configurations to analyze variability and error rates in complex building layouts.
Acoustic Studies: Serve as a practical tool for researchers and engineers studying sound propagation, fire alarm effectiveness, and building acoustics.

# How to Use
1. Download the application.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Input the relevant building dimensions, materials, and sounder specifications.
4. Select a calculation method (Butler, Bowyer, and Kew or Halliwell and Sultan).
5. View and export results for further analysis.
 
# Who Can Use This?
Fire safety engineers designing alarm systems.
Researchers studying sound propagation in buildings.
Students and academics working on fire safety and acoustics.
